100 boxes is a game I made in order to demo my isometric game engine built on top of 
a basic rust rendering library called macroquad, that provided me with basic 2D rendering
primitives. It features most of the engine's systems: basic 2d lighting, animations and 
isometric graphics. I also built a level editor for the engine which was used to create 
the levels and animations seen in the game. It was supposed to have a 100 levels, but
it currently has only 9. I am thinking of making a new version of it with my current 
3D engine project, but we will have to see.
