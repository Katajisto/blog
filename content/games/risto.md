Help Risto get back home! A game jam game for Ludum Dare 54 made by me and Matias Järvenpää.
Made with the same custom rust engine as 100 boxes, but this game kind of started showing the
limits of the engine and played a part in me wanting to start working on a new 3D engine that
will help me ship some game some day.
