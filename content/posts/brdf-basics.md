## Intro
I am currently writing a path tracer in order to calculate indirect and bake in lighting for my game engine.
Since understanding the BRDF is a quite vital part of the path tracer, I'll try to simplify my findings here 
while I am trying to understand it.

The BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) is a function that tells us that when there is incoming light from a direction, 
how
