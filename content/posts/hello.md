## Welcome to my blog.

I have probably started around 10 blogs about programming during my 
time programming. None of these were of any interest to anyone,
since I had nothing interesting to say, since I knew almost nothing and 
I never did anything that was new in any way.

This might still be true, but after 10 years of doing this I wanted to atleast try to pay back the
amount of times I managed to fix or do something specific only because
someone else, way more advanced than me, had already figured it out
and posted simple instructions for people like me to follow.

I am an eternal student of programming and still in the beginning
of the journey, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. I will mostly post
things about gamedev and maybe Zig related things, that I had a hard time
figuring out.
