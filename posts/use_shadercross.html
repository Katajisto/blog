    <h2>19.2.2025</h2>
    I have been writing a new renderer for my engine using the new and interesting SDL GPU API.
    This has been mostly a nice exprience, but working with shaders across platforms has been really
    annoying.
    </br></br>
    This is just a quick note, that atleast for me, writing shaders in Slang to compile shaders to Metal and SPIR-V for use
    with the GPU API, has been very annoying and things were constantly breaking between Metal and Vulkan. I think it's a good idea to
    just write HLSL and use SDL_shadercross to compile those to Metal and SPIR-V.
