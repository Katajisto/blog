    <h1>Why this blog is just a bunch of HTML files</h1>

    <h2>23.1.2025</h2>
    I was about to update this blog with the post about a SDL3 renderer for microui, and how that enabled me to create
    UIs with very little code. Once I started updating the blog I realized I don't have Hugo (the static site generator)
    I used for generating the site installed on my current machine.
    <br/>
    Well, I obviously went and downloaded the newest build and tried to build the site. To my surprise this did not work.
    There were multiple fields in the static site generation configuration that were now deprecated... This was precisely the
    scenario I wanted to avoid when I decided to just publish the site using Hugo. I do not really care for having to
    do some npm upgrade process to get my site back working, but I was again about to look up a migration guide to get my site
    to work so I could add the post.
    <br/>
    Then I just started thinking about what do I even need a site generator for? The site was very basic looking and just had some posts.
    I achieved pretty much the same minimal visuals with just a few HTML files I wrote in around 20 minutes, and now adding a new post or updating the site will
    never again force me down some annoying path to find what's deprecated and what is not. Writing the posts in plain HTML is also suprisingly pleasant.
