      <description>100 boxes is a game I made in order to demo my isometric game engine built on top of a basic rust rendering library called macroquad, that provided me with basic 2D rendering primitives. It features most of the engine&amp;rsquo;s systems: basic 2d lighting, animations and isometric graphics. I also built a level editor for the engine which was used to create the levels and animations seen in the game.</description>

      <description>Help Risto get back home! A game jam game for Ludum Dare 54 made by me and Matias Järvenpää. Made with the same custom rust engine as 100 boxes, but this game kind of started showing the limits of the engine and played a part in me wanting to start working on a new 3D engine that will help me ship some game some day.</description>
